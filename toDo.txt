# settings for a town (i.e. anyone not a resident. HIGH priority? medium for one listener and high on the other to allow plot-based to override? Needs to allow plot permissions to override). Default ON to everything?: 
- Disable entry (retry the plotChangeEvent to avoid overhead of playerMoveEvent)
- Including teleport / portal events / fluids?
- Disable clicking
- Disable interactions
- Disable break/place/use
- Give outsider “access rights” i.e. entry
# settings for a plot - by default overrides town settings
same as the above, but can be overridden. 
# What to do about embassy? commercial? maybe disable the entry/tp requirements? Check ifOwner?
